            I found all the original SmaugFUSS archives I could find and
            imported them into git, to provide a history from version 1.4a
            up to the present version 1.9.

            for i in 1.4a 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9; do
                git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f
                find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -print0 | grep -z '^./[a-zA-Z0-9_]' | xargs -0 rm -rf
                cp -rp ../smaug_archive/$i/* .
                RECENT=`find . -type f -printf '%TY-%Tm-%Td %TT %p\n' | grep -v .git | colrm 20 | sort -r | head -1`
                export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="$RECENT"
                export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="$RECENT"
                echo -en "$i\t$RECENT\n" >VERSION
                find . -type d -empty -exec touch -d "$RECENT" {}/.gitignore \;
                git add -A
                git commit -m "SmaugFUSS $i"
                git tag $i
            done

            These changes were simply to get gcc 4.7 to compile things cleanly.
            In most cases, this was the removal of unused variables.

            This installs the last I3 client software into SmaugFUSS and sets
            up a new default router and a handful of channels.  The admin player
            file has the i3 data fields included, as i3 appears not to work unless
            you save and re-enter the game.

            I finally got I3 support fixed, along with some other minor fixes
            to general color handling, so that URL's are properly escaped and
            should not be screwed up if they contain ampersands.

            Pinkfish conversion (to and from) was rewritten entirely, and the
            order things come in the i3.color file now MATTERS!  Strings must
            be checked in order, from longest to shortest, so that combinations
            like %^BOLD%^RED%^ are found before %^RED%^ is, to avoid orphaned
            %^BOLD tags that would break native color code.

            I went through and renamed every instance of a file access I could
            find so that EVERYTHING uses full pathnames (relative, actually)
            and thus shouldn't care if you start the MUD in the area subdir, or
            the src subdir, or any subdir.  Because of the way it works, it'll
            still fail if you start in the top level directory.

            Fixed a bug introduced by my changes above.  This had to do with
            the assumption that only object save data was in hotboot/, so any
            entries that weren't valid got unlinked.  Problem is, we put the
            mob and copyover files in there now, so they were getting unlinked
            before we were done with them.

            Easy fix, just have the obj restore thing skip files that don't
            start with a digit, since the filename is just the vnum.

            This is a small update to state that a LOT of changes were merged
            in from Kayle and Samson over the last couple of years.  This
            version brings us back up to date with them, keeping my own
            changes in place (where applicable).

            To see a detailed list of THOSE changes, refer to the git log
            command's output, copied from their repositories.

            Fixed a small bug in do_mortalize(), and removed an unused test
            version of a function in color.c
